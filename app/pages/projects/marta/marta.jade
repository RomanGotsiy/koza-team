        p For the first time in my life shot video portrait. A small Martha Syrkoâs story, who is wonderful person and equally wonderful photographer, a story about how dramatically photography changed her entire life. Hours of filming and weeks of editing, that's what we got as a result. Special thanks to Taras Govda and Sofiia Korotkevych. English subtitles included! Enjoy)
